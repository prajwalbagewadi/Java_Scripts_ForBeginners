The reserved keywords in JavaScript are predefined keywords 
used to serve the built-in functionality of the programming language. 
For example, the var and let keywords are used to define variables, the function keyword is used to define the functions, etc.
JavaScript contains more that fifty reserved keywords.

In simple terms, you can't use the reserved keywords as an identifier. 
If you do, you will get the conflicts, and the code will generate the wrong output or throw an error.

For example, the below code will throw an error as ‘function’ is used as an identifier.
var function=10; // will produce a error
